# Friendship7-3D-Visualization

This repository contains work and code for the NASA Datanauts project titled 3D Orbital Data Visualization of the Friendship 7 Flight.

This work is a product of the NASA Datanauts community.

NASA Datanauts is an international community of people interested in learning how to develop data science skills through access to and use of NASA’s open data. This class or cohort of 50 Datanauts will be the first class of 2018!

You do not have to be a hardcore coder to be a Datanaut (although those are welcome too)! Borne out of NASA’s Women in Data initiative, the Datanaut program is open to anyone interested in technology, data science, earth and space. Our activities encourage collaboration between members, the merging of ideas and skill-sharing.

/b NASA Datanauts:

Receive guidance on accessing and incorporating NASA data into projects;

Pursue a variety of skills-learning tracks led by NASA and other experts, such as an introduction to R and GitHub;

Gain access to a community of like-minded problem solvers, creators and people passionate about skill-building and sharing;

Attend or organize virtual and live community events to showcase or collaborate on projects;

Engage in dialogue with experts on data science, technology, earth, space and other related fields such as social science, gaming, media, arts, fashion; and

Will have the opportunity to organize and present self-driven, collaborative projects and engage in NASA-created data projects, and potentially learn new or refine existing skills.

Ultimately, Datanauts are given access to tools and an environment to facilitate collaboration on ideas and projects that leverage NASA data.
